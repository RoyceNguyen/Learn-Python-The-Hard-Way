Rules going through the book:

1. Go through each exercise, no skipping.

2. Type in each file exactly.

3. Make it Run. Debug/Fix issues as they come up.

4. DO NOT copy-paste, hand-type only.

5. DO NOT use an IDE, text-editors only, try not to rely on extensions either.

6. Keep on practicing. Persistence is key.
